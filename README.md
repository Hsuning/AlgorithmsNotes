# AlgorithmsNotes
Obsidian notes for data structures and algorithms

### Grokking Algorithms from Aditya Y. Bhargava (https://github.com/egonSchiele/grokking_algorithms)
- Very beginner-friendly and easy to understand
- With lots of interesting examples and pictures, it is a pleasure to read it
- It only covers basic data structures and algorithms, but still useful to read if you want to review all the basics. Personally, love this phrase : "Sometimes, perfect is the enemy of good. Sometimes all you need is an algorithm that solves the problem pretty well. ""
- Useful to learn how to explain the universe to the general audience

Next: 
- Reorganise all the notes and add some more python code example
- Start to read next wonderful book
