# AlgorithmsNotes
Obsidian notes for data structures and algorithms


I am currently reviewing algorithms using Grokking Algorithms from Aditya Y. Bhargava (https://github.com/egonSchiele/grokking_algorithms).

This is a wonderful book if you want to learn how to explain the universe to the general audience.
