#RandomAccess 
- Jump directly to Nth element

#SequentialAccess	
- Reading the elements one by one, starting at the first element

#IterativeMethod
- The iteration is controlled throught the looping condition
- Space complexity: O(1)
- Ex: while ... return

#RecursiveMethod
- No loop. Rather than passing the new values to the next iteration of the loop, it passes them to next recursion.
- Space complexity : O(log n)
- Ex: return Function()
