#NPCompleteProblems
- You have to calculate every possible set to solve the set covering problem
- No known fast solution
- Definition
	- Algorithm runs quickly with few items but slows down with more items. 
	- You want to find all combinations of X
	- Have to calculate every possible version? Find the shortest route that goes to all 20 homes.
	- Involves a sequences (like sequence of cities) and hard to solve
	- Involves a set (set of stations) and hard to solve. Finding the largest clique in a set of people.
	- Some problems are famously hard to solve (traveling salesperson and #SetCoveringProblem )
	- Factorial function - the number of calculation becomes big very fast
	- #knapsackproblem: a knasack can carry 4lb of goods, which items should you pick so that you get the maximum money's worth of goods
