#NPCompleteProblems
- You have to calculate every possible set to solve the set covering problem
- No known fast solution
- Definition
	- Algorithm runs quickly with few items but slows down with more items
	- You want to find all combinations of X
	- Have to calculate every possible version? 
	- Involves a sequences (like sequence of cities) and hard to solve
	- Involves a set (set of stations) and hard to solve
	- Some problems are famously hard to solve (traveling salesperson and #SetCoveringProblem )
	- Factorial function - the number of calculation becomes big very fast
- Use #GreedyAlgorithm to solve
