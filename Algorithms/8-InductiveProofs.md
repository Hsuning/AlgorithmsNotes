#InductiveProofs
- one way to prove that your algorithm works
- Each inductive proof has two steps: the base case and the inductive case
	- Base: algorithm works for the base case: arrays of size 0 and 1
	- inductive: if quicksort works for an array of size 1, it will work for an array of size 2 and so on. Then I can say that quicksort will work for all arrays of any size.
