#Breadth-firstSearch #BFS
- Use: #Graphs 
- Shortest-path problem: “What’s the shortest path to go to X?”. Find the shortest distance between two things
	- Write a checkers AI that calculates the fewest moves to victory
	- Write a spell checker (fewest edits from your misspelling to a real word—for example, READED -> READER is one edit)
	- Find the doctor closest to you in your network
- Algorithms: 
	1.  Model the problem as a #Graphs .
	2. Solve the problem using breadth-first search: can we get there in 1, 2, 3, 4, ... steps
		- Is there a path from node A to node B ? (Is there a mango seller in your network?)
		- What is the shortest path from node A to node B? (Who is the closest mango seller?)
	3. Search in a queue : first-degree then second then third


#Queue
- Similar to stack. #SequentialAccess
- Enqueue
- Dequeue
