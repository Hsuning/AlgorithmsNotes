#LinearProgramming

- maximize something given some constraints
- For example, suppose your company makes two products, shirts and totes. Shirts need 1 meter of fabric and 5 buttons. Totes need 2 meters of fabric and 2 buttons. You have 11 meters of fabric and 20 buttons. You make $2 per shirt and $3 per tote. How many shirts and totes should you make to maximize your profit?
- All the graph algorithms can be done through linear programming instead
- Simplex algorithm
