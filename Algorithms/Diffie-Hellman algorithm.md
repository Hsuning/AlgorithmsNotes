#DiffieHellmanAlgorithm

- A way to encrypt a message so it can only be read by the person you sent the message to
- The encrypted messages are extremely hard to decode
- Algorithms:
	- 2 keys: a public key and a private key
	- use public key to encrypt the message
	- an encrypted message can only be decrpyted using the private key
